# ClientRepaymentAbilities
## Description

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories and
unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.
X-Credit Solution strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by
providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved
population has a positive loan experience, X-Credit Solution makes use of a variety of
alternative data including telco and transactional information to predict their clients' repayment
abilities.

While X-Credit Solution is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to
make these predictions, your task is to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so
will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a
principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
Submissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability
and the observed target.
